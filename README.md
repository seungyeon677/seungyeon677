# Hi there, I'm Seungyeon Lee 👋

I am a **Master's student in Geography** at Kyung Hee University, specializing in **GeoAI and Spatio-temporal Data Analytics**. My research focuses on enhancing urban safety and resilience through advanced spatial modeling and deep learning frameworks.

### 🔍 Research Interests
* **GeoAI & Spatial Deep Learning:** Developing GNN-based frameworks (GCN, STGCN) for urban risk prediction.
* **Urban Mobility & Traffic Safety:** Spatiotemporal network-based traffic congestion and safety analysis.
* **Spatial Disparity & Accessibility:** Accessibility modeling (2SFCA) and vulnerability assessment.

### 🛠 Technical Skills
* **Language:** English, Korean
* **Programming & Simulation:** **Python**, PyTorch, R, AnyLogic
* **GIS & Remote Sensing:** **ArcGIS Pro**, **QGIS**, Pix4D Mapper

### 🚀 Publications
